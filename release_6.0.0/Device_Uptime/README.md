# Converting Different Uptime Formats to Minutes

This explains how the following complex one-liner works to convert various uptime formats into minutes:

```python
total_minutes = (int(Uptime.split('w')[0]) * 7 * 24 * 60 + int(Uptime.split('d')[0].split('w')[-1]) * 24 * 60 + int(Uptime.split(':')[0].split(' ')[-1]) * 60 + int(Uptime.split(':')[1].split(' ')[0])) if 'w' in Uptime else ((int(Uptime.split('d')[0]) * 24 * 60 + int(Uptime.split(':')[0].split(' ')[-1]) * 60 + int(Uptime.split(':')[1].split(' ')[0])) if 'd' in Uptime and 'days' not in Uptime else ((int(Uptime.split(' ')[0]) * 24 * 60 + int(Uptime.split(':')[0].split(', ')[-1]) * 60 + int(Uptime.split(':')[1])) if ' day' in Uptime else ((int(Uptime.split(':')[0]) * 60 + int(Uptime.split(':')[1]) + int(Uptime.split(':')[2]) // 60) if len(Uptime.split(':')) > 2 else ((int(Uptime.split(':')[0]) * 60 + int(Uptime.split(':')[1])) if ':' in Uptime else int(Uptime.split(' ')[0]) if ' mins' in Uptime or ' min' in Uptime else 0))))
```

## Supported Formats

This solution handles the following formats:

1. `1w2d 00:26:08` - Weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds
2. `2d 00:26:08` - Days, hours, minutes, seconds
3. `48 days, 22:39` - Days with comma, hours, minutes
4. `00:26:08` - Hours, minutes, seconds
5. `22:39` - Hours, minutes
6. `36 mins` - Just minutes

## How It Works

The expression uses nested conditional (ternary) operators to determine which format is being processed and apply the appropriate conversion logic. Let's break it down:

### First Level Condition: Checking for Weeks

```python
... if 'w' in Uptime else ...
```

If the string contains 'w' (indicating weeks), we extract and convert weeks, days, hours, and minutes:

```python
int(Uptime.split('w')[0]) * 7 * 24 * 60 + 
int(Uptime.split('d')[0].split('w')[-1]) * 24 * 60 + 
int(Uptime.split(':')[0].split(' ')[-1]) * 60 + 
int(Uptime.split(':')[1].split(' ')[0])
```

This handles formats like `1w2d 00:26:08` by:
- Converting weeks to minutes: `1w` → `1 * 7 * 24 * 60 = 10,080 minutes`
- Converting days to minutes: `2d` → `2 * 24 * 60 = 2,880 minutes`
- Converting hours to minutes: `00` → `0 * 60 = 0 minutes`
- Adding minutes: `26` → `26 minutes`
- Total: `10,080 + 2,880 + 0 + 26 = 12,986 minutes`

### Second Level Condition: Checking for Days (without "days" text)

```python
... if 'd' in Uptime and 'days' not in Uptime else ...
```

If the string contains 'd' but not 'days', we extract and convert days, hours, and minutes:

```python
int(Uptime.split('d')[0]) * 24 * 60 + 
int(Uptime.split(':')[0].split(' ')[-1]) * 60 + 
int(Uptime.split(':')[1].split(' ')[0])
```

This handles formats like `2d 00:26:08` by:
- Converting days to minutes: `2d` → `2 * 24 * 60 = 2,880 minutes`
- Converting hours to minutes: `00` → `0 * 60 = 0 minutes`
- Adding minutes: `26` → `26 minutes`
- Total: `2,880 + 0 + 26 = 2,906 minutes`

### Third Level Condition: Checking for "day" or "days"

```python
... if ' day' in Uptime else ...
```

If the string contains ' day' (matching both 'day' and 'days'), we handle formats like `48 days, 22:39`:

```python
int(Uptime.split(' ')[0]) * 24 * 60 + 
int(Uptime.split(':')[0].split(', ')[-1]) * 60 + 
int(Uptime.split(':')[1])
```

This works by:
- Converting days to minutes: `48 days` → `48 * 24 * 60 = 69,120 minutes`
- Converting hours to minutes: `22` → `22 * 60 = 1,320 minutes`
- Adding minutes: `39` → `39 minutes`
- Total: `69,120 + 1,320 + 39 = 70,479 minutes`

### Fourth Level Condition: Checking for HH:MM:SS Format

```python
... if len(Uptime.split(':')) > 2 else ...
```

If the string contains two colons (three time components), we handle formats like `00:26:08`:

```python
int(Uptime.split(':')[0]) * 60 + 
int(Uptime.split(':')[1]) + 
int(Uptime.split(':')[2]) // 60
```

This works by:
- Converting hours to minutes: `00` → `0 * 60 = 0 minutes`
- Adding minutes directly: `26` → `26 minutes`
- Converting seconds to minutes (integer division): `08` → `8 // 60 = 0 minutes`
- Total: `0 + 26 + 0 = 26 minutes`

### Fifth Level Condition: Checking for HH:MM Format

```python
... if ':' in Uptime else ...
```

If the string contains a colon but only one (two time components), we handle formats like `22:39`:

```python
int(Uptime.split(':')[0]) * 60 + 
int(Uptime.split(':')[1])
```

This works by:
- Converting hours to minutes: `22` → `22 * 60 = 1,320 minutes`
- Adding minutes directly: `39` → `39 minutes`
- Total: `1,320 + 39 = 1,359 minutes`

### Sixth Level Condition: Checking for Minutes Only

```python
... if ' mins' in Uptime or ' min' in Uptime else 0
```

Finally, if the string contains 'mins' or 'min', we handle formats like `36 mins`:

```python
int(Uptime.split(' ')[0])
```

This simply extracts the number before 'mins': `36 mins` → `36 minutes`

## Why One Line?

This solution is written as a one-liner to comply with the query language requirements specified in the documentation. The query language requires expressions to be written in a single line that returns a value.

## Conversion Factors Used

- 1 week = 7 days = 7 * 24 * 60 = 10,080 minutes
- 1 day = 24 hours = 24 * 60 = 1,440 minutes
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 60 seconds = 1 minute (using integer division `//` for seconds)
